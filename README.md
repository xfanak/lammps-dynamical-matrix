# lammps-dynamical-matrix
Use lammps to obtain dynamical matrix, and the corresponding fortran post-processing codes.
The KSPACE, MOLECULE, and USER-PHONON, and other necessary packages must be enabled when compling lammps. 
Part of the input files are supplied here. 
The obtained DM can be processed using the FORTRAN code provided.
